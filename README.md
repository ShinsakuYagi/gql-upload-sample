# gql-upload-sample

Go GraphQL file upload sample

## Introduction

GraphQL file upload with [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) .

Use the default `localhost:8080` and `Postman` to verify the operation.

## Getting Started

### Start Server

```sh
> make start
```

(It should work...ðŸ¤¤ If you have any problems, please send us an issue or PRðŸ˜‹)

### Query With Postman

Import `postman/gql-upload-sample.postman_collection.json` into Postman on your machine and use it.

â€»It's a pain to edit, so I'm just pasting the JSON from my environment.
You will need to select a file. Files can be selected from the Postman App UI.
